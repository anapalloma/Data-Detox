## Data Detox ðŸ§¹ðŸ§¼ðŸ“Š

This application is being developed to facilitate the process of cleaning and treating data from the National System of Notifiable Diseases Information (SINAN).

SINAN is a brazilian epidemiological surveillance system that collects information on notifiable diseases throughout the country. However, the collected data is often incomplete or contains errors, which can compromise the quality of the analysis and studies based on this information.

From the exposed problem, the first module of the app was created, aimed at Personal Data treatment.Its main functionalities are:
- Calculation of user age on the date of notification;
- Identification and automatic correction of common errors in neighborhood names;
- Automated filling of missing information;
- Export of treated data to xlsx format.

New updates coming soon!
